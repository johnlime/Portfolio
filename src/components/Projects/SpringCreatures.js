            <h2> Methodology </h2>
            <p>PyBox2D is used for the physics simulations. Gravity is removed for less complexity. Linear damping can be used to simulate a crude approximation of fluid dynamics. </p>

            <p>The virtual creatures are depicted using rigid bodies, revolute joints, and springs. Each spring is composed of a distance joint and a prismatic joint to enable control over material while having damping properties and a resting position, resulting in a soft-body-like material. Each spring is set to oscillate in a sine wave.</p>

            <p> The morphology of each virtual creature is procedurally generated, starting from a square of width 5 as the initial base of the creature. A ruleset, defined by a neural network consisting of 2 input neurons and 5 output neurons, dictates how a new limb grows from the perimeter of each body of the morphology. 10 equally separated points from each edge of the body are defined, and their locations are inputted into the neural network ruleset, allowing limb growth from the perimeter of the bodies. This process is recursively executed per newly generated body limb to form a full morphology for the virtual creature. </p>

            <p> The 2 input neurons are 2 floating-point values indicating the location of the stem of the new potential limb. The 5 output neurons set the specifications for the new limb. </p>
            <ul>
              <li> Binary value of whether or not to generate a new limb stemming from the body </li>
              <li> Floating-point angle of the joint </li>
              <li> Floating-point distance from the stem of the joint to the new body to be generated </li>
              <li> 2-dimensional floating-point of width and height of the new body </li>
            </ul>

              <figcaption style={{textAlign:"center"}}> Diagram of procedural generation for creature morphology </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p> If a generated spring-prismatic joint collides with another body or joint, it merges with them. This mechanism should make complex structures, such as muscle-like mechanism over 2 bodies and a revolute joint. </p>

            <p> The followiing is a demonstration of a procedurally generated creature. </p>

            </figure>

            <p> NEAT algorithm was used to search for the configuration of the neural network that would enable the generated morphology to conduct locomotion alongside the x-axis the best. </p>

            <p> The locomotion task is defined as a summation of rewards <Latex> $r_t$ </Latex> generated every timestep <Latex> $t$ </Latex>. <Latex> $x_t$ </Latex> and <Latex> $y_t$ </Latex> indicate the location of the initial base body of the creature.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <Latex>{"$r_t = sign(x_t - x_{t-1}) (x_t - x_{t-1})^2 - (y_t - y_{t-1})^2$"}
            </Latex>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <Latex> {"$sign(): \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\{1, -1\\}$"} </Latex> outputs 1 if the value is positive and -1 if the value is negative. </p>

            <h2> Experiment </h2>
            <p> 400 generations of NEAT were conducted, with the size of the population set as 250 and the mutation rate set to 0.8. The NEAT network adopted a feed-forward network, and its genomes were connected partially with a probability of 0.5. The probability that mutation adds a connection between existing nodes was 0.2, and the probability that it deletes a connection was 0.2. The activation function was tanh. Moreover, we set the chance that the mutation will change the bias of a node as 0.7, and this bias can range from -30 to 30. The maximum value of the weight in NEAT was 30, and the minimum was -30. The probability that mutations changes the weight of the network was 0.8. The elitism of 2 individuals is implemented. </p>

            <h2> Result </h2>
            <p> The NEAT algorithm was successfully able to generate that successfully propels itself forward along the x-axis. </p>
